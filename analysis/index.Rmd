Welcome to the website summarising the soybean R-gene analysis.

0. Reading in and organising data: [link](initial_data_organisation.html)

1. Exploration of just the modern US lines, turns out they are quite genetically 
similar (at least in terms of NBS genes) and so relatively uninteresting: 
[link](Modern_USA_initial_exploration.html)

1. Expand exploration of NBS genes to all lines, beggining with exploration of 
some stepwise regression model selection investigating increasing orders of 
interactions between genes:
